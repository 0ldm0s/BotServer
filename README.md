Welcome to General Bots Community Edition!
-------

General Bots is a package based chat bot server focused in convention
over configuration and code-less approaches, which brings software packages  
and application server concepts to help parallel bot development.

Everyone can create bots by just copying and pasting some files and using their
favorite tools like Excel (or any text editor) or Photoshop (or any image
editor).

### What is Bot Server?

Bot Server accelerates the process of developing a bot. It provisions all code
base, resources and deployment to the cloud, and gives you templates you can
choose from whenever you need a new bot. The server has a database and service 
backend allowing you to further modify your bot package directly by downloading 
a zip file, editing and uploading it back to the server (deploying process) with 
no code. The Bot Server also provides a framework to develop bot packages in a more
advanced fashion writing custom code in editors like Visual Studio Code, Atom or Brackets.

### The same build process for everyone

GeneralBots aims to delivery bots in azure in a very easy and fast fashion. Use
Office tools like Word or Excel to edit your Bot - using code (JavaScript or TypeScript) just to empower custom requirements.

How To
------

### Run the server

1. `git clone https://github.com/pragmatismo-io/BotServer.git` or just download the files to a folder;
2. Run `npm install` on that folder;
3. Enter './deploy/default.gbui' folder and run `npm install` folled by `npm run build` (To build default Bot UI);
4. On the downloaded folder (../..), run the bot server by `npm start`.

### Updating the Bot Knoledge Base (.gbkb folder)

The subjects.json file contains all information related to the subject tree and can be used to build the menu carrousel as well give a set of words to be used as subject catcher in the conversation. A hierarchy can be specified.

### Creating a new Theme folder (.gbtheme folder)

A theme is composed of some CSS files and images. That set of files can change
everything in the General Bots UI. Use them extensively before going to change
the UI application itself (HTML & JS).

Package Types
-------------

### .gbai

Embraces all packages types (content, logic & conversation) into a pluggable bot
directory.

### .gbapp

The artificial intelligence extensions in form of pluggable apps. Dialogs,
Services and all model related to data. A set of interactions, use cases, 
integrations in form of conversationals dialogs.
The .gbapp adds the General Bots base library (botlib) for building Node.js TypeScript Apps packages.


Four components builds up a General Bots App:

* dialogs
* models
* services
* tests

#### Dialogs

All code contained in a dialog builds the flow to custom conversations in 
built-in and additional packages .


#### Models

Models builds the foundation of data relationships in form of entities.


#### Services

Services are a fa√ßade for bot back-end logic and other custom processing.


#### Tests

Tests try to automate code execution validation before crashing in production.


### .gbot

An expression of an artificial inteligence entity. A .gbot file defines 
all bots dependencies related to services and other resources.

### .gbtheme

A theme of a bot at a given time. CSS files & images that can compose all UI
presentation and using it a branding can be done.

### .gbkb

A set of subjects that bot knows.


### .gblib

Shared code that can be used across bot apps.

### GeneralBots admin commands

General Bots can be controlled by the same chat window people talk to, so 
here is a list of admin commands related to deploying .gb* files.

| Command         | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| deployPackage   | Deploy a KB package. Usage **deployPackage** [package-name]. Then, you need to run rebuildIndex.                |
| undeployPackage | Undeploy a KB. Usage **undeployPackage** [package-name].                                                        |
| redeployPackage | Undeploy and then deploys the KB. Usage **redeployPackage** [package-name]. Then, you need to run rebuildIndex. |
| rebuildIndex    | Rebuild Azure Search indexes, must be run after **deployPackage** or **redeployPackage**.                       |
